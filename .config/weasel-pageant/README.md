weasel-pageant
--------------

`weasel-pageant` allows you to use SSH keys held by [PuTTY's](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)
Pageant "daemon" (or compatible, such as the version of Pageant included in 
[PuTTY-CAC](https://github.com/NoMoreFood/putty-cac) or the SSH agent mode in
[Gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org/)) from inside the
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about).

The source (and this documentation) is heavily based on
[`ssh-pageant`](https://github.com/cuviper/ssh-pageant) 1.4 by Josh Stone, which allows
interacting with Pageant from Cygwin/MSYS programs.

`weasel-pageant` works like `ssh-agent`, except that it leaves the key storage to
PuTTY's Pageant.  It sets up an authentication socket and prints the environment
variables, which allows the OpenSSH client to use it. It works by executing from the
WSL side a Win32 helper program which interfaces with Pageant and communicating with
it through pipes.

It is probably the most useful if your SSH keys can't be copied to the WSL environment,
such as when using a smart card for SSH authentication. Testing is mainly performed
with Pageant-CAC, though Gpg4win has been seen to work in the past. Note that when
using Gpg4win, only the SSH agent part will be forwarded. There is no support for
forwarding the GPG agent socket.

**SECURITY NOTICE:** All the usual security caveats applicable to WSL apply.
Most importantly, all interaction with the Win32 world happens with the credentials of
the user who started the WSL environment. In practice, *if you allow someone else to
log in to your WSL environment remotely, they may be able to access the SSH keys stored in
your Pageant with `weasel-pageant`.* This is a fundamental feature of WSL; if you
are not sure of what you're doing, do not allow remote access to your WSL environment
(e.g. by starting an SSH server).

`weasel-pageant` does not work on a version of Windows 10 older
than 1703 ("Creators Update"), because it requires the
[Windows/Ubuntu interoperability support](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/2016/10/19/windows-and-ubuntu-interoperability/)
feature shipped with that version. It has been verified to work with versions
up to and including Windows 10 release 1903.

## Installation

### From binaries

Download the zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/vuori/weasel-pageant/releases)
and unpack it in a convenient location *on the Windows part of your drive*.

Because WSL can only execute Win32 binaries from `drvfs` locations, `weasel-pageant`
*will not work* if unpacked inside the WSL filesystem (onto an `lxfs` mount).
Advanced users may place only `helper.exe` on `drvfs`, but in general it is easier
to keep the pieces together.

### From source

A VS2019 project is included. You will need the "Desktop development with C++" and
"Linux development with C++" features. To build:

1. Optional: In Visual Studio, set up an SSH connection to a Linux machine. If you want
   to build using your local WSL environment, the default configuration should work.

2. Optional: If you intend to work on the Linux sources, copy the contents of
   `/usr/include` into `linux/include` under the project directory.
   This is not required for the build, but will make Intellisense more useful.

3. Hit Build Solution. Both the Linux executable and the Win32 helper will be built.

If you want to create a binary package, you can use the `create_pkg.py` script
at the root of the project. This should work with Python 3.4 or newer on either
Windows or Linux.

Alternatively you can build the Linux executable directly on Linux and only use
Visual Studio for the Win32 helper (no Makefile or similar is supplied at the moment).
In theory the helper should be buildable with MinGW-w64 for a fully Linux-based
build, but this has not been tested.

The release binaries have been built with VS2019 16.2.0.

## Usage

Using `weasel-pageant` is generally similar to using `ssh-agent` on Linux and
similar operating systems. 

1. Ensure that PuTTY's Pageant is running (and holds your SSH keys).
    * `weasel-pageant` does not start Pageant itself.
    * Recommended: Add Pageant to your Windows startup/Autostart configuration
      so it is always available.

2. Edit your `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile`) to add the following:

        eval $(<location where you unpacked the zip>/weasel-pageant -r)

    To explain:

    * This leverages the `-r`/`--reuse` option which will only start a new daemon if
      one is not already running in the current window. If the agent socket appears to
      be active, it will just print environment variables and exit.

    * Using `eval` will set the environment variables in the current shell.
      By default, `weasel-pageant` tries to detect the current shell and output
      appropriate commands. If detection fails, then use the `-S SHELL` option
      to define a shell type manually.

3. Restart your shell or type (when using bash) `. ~/.bashrc`. Typing `ssh-add -l`
   should now list the keys you have registered in Pageant.

### Note regarding the `-a` flag

A previous version of this manual suggested using the `-a` flag to set a fixed
socket path which could be reused by all open WSL consoles. Due to the limitations of
WSL-Win32 interop, this causes problems including hanging SSH agent connections
and hanging `conhost` processes in many use cases. Unless you have a specific need
for a fixed socket path, it is better to remove the `-a` flag froom your `weasel-pageant`
startup command. A `weasel-pageant` instance will then be started for each WSL console
you open.

However, with Windows 10 version 1809 or newer, it is now possible to use a fixed
socket path reliably. In addition to the `-a` flag, also set the `-b` to prevent
the `weasel-pageant` process from exiting with its parent console. For example
to create a persistent socket in your home directory:

    eval $(<location where you unpacked the zip>/weasel-pageant -rb -a $HOME/.weasel-pageant.sock)

## Options

`weasel-pageant` aims to be compatible with `ssh-agent` options, with a few extras:

    $ weasel-pageant -h
    Usage: weasel-pageant [options] [command [arg ...]]
    Options:
      -h, --help     Show this help.
      -v, --version  Display version information.
      -c             Generate C-shell commands on stdout.
      -s             Generate Bourne shell commands on stdout.
      -S SHELL       Generate shell command for "bourne", "csh", or "fish".
      -k             Kill the current weasel-pageant.
      -d             Enable debug mode.
      -q             Enable quiet mode.
      -a SOCKET      Create socket on a specific path.
      -r, --reuse    Allow to reuse an existing -a SOCKET.
      -H, --helper   Path to the Win32 helper binary (default: /mnt/c/Program Files/weasel-pageant/helper.exe).
      -t TIME        Limit key lifetime in seconds (not supported by Pageant).
      -b             Do not exit when tty closes (only use on Windows 10 version 1809 and newer).

By default, the Win32 helper will be searched for in the same directory where `weasel-pageant`
is installed. If you have placed `helper.exe` elsewhere, the `-H` flag can be used to set the
location.

## Known issues

* If you have an `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` variable set inside `screen`, `tmux` or similar,
  you exit the WSL console from which the `screen` was *initially started* and attach
  to the session from another window, the agent connection will not be usable. This is
  due to WSL/Win32 interop limitations. This can be circumvented on Windows 10 version
  1809 and newer by adding the `-b` flag to the `weasel-pageant` command line.

* There is a slight delay when exiting a WSL console before the window actually closes.
  This is due to a polling loop which works around a WSL incompatibility with Unix session
  semantics.

## Uninstallation

To uninstall, just remove the extracted files and any modifications you made
to your shell initialization files (e.g. `.bashrc`).

## Version History

* 2017-06-25: 1.0 - Initial release.
* 2018-03-30: 1.1 - Fixed console/agent connection hangs and enabled restarting of the helper.
  **Upgrade note:** remove the `-a` flag from the `weasel-pageant` command line unless you
  know you need it.
* 2019-01-06: 1.2 - Fixed unexpected daemon exits caused by a signal handling issue.
* 2019-03-10: 1.3 - Added the `-b` flag to prevent the daemon from exiting when its
  parent terminal closes. Requires Windows 10 1809 or newer. Thanks to @niklasholm for
  the patch.
* 2019-08-04: 1.4 - Added a workaround for a Win32 interop bug in Windows 10 1903 that wedged
  the WSL init process into an infinite loop. Also switched to static linking the Linux
  binary for compatibility with non-glibc distributions such as Alpine.
